Download GoG games under Linux

How to use it
=============
1. Log on GoG.com
2. Take your cookies from your browser (too lazy to made a script for this now) with https://addons.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/addon/cookies-exportimport/ for example
3. Name it cookies.txt and put it in the folder
4. Copy links from your account on GoG.com
5. Launch the script


Why ?
=====
I tried to download some games from Linux while working (from http://www.gogwiki.com/wiki/Download_Clients ). None work. So I made it with the only thing that doesn't evolve : sh, wget, sed.

Roots. But works.
